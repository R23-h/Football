## Description:
This script was created in Python with the goal of converting a list into a dictionary, to make it easier to organize and arrange data effectively. The program starts by representing player information as a list with sub-lists, where each sub-list represents a specific player's data such as name, position, and age. The script includes three main steps that help turn a list into a dictionary in an organized and understandable way.


## Key functions :

`1.def list_to_dict(value):`

Purpose :  The player list is entered and converted into a dictionary, making it easy to access each player's information through the dictionary with the keys. 

 `2.def group_by_position(value):`

Purpose : Each player is categorized with all his information such as his location and birth date according to the team he belongs to, which helps in displaying each team's 
players. 

 `3.def players_by_country_and_position(value):`

Purpose : Each player is further categorized according to each country with its team and each team with its players to help categorize each country with its teams.

## Why This Script Matters:

`1.Data organization:`
This script makes dealing with random data more efficient and clear.

`2.Flexibility of use:`
The structured dictionaries resulting from these steps are easily used in programming, analysis, or even presentations.

`3.Practicality:`
Suitable for many situations such as managing sports teams, analyzing player data, or designing sports apps.
